This is a project based on Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!".  
The initial commit was entirely explained in the course.  
The other commits were developed by me, in order to complete some of Jonas' challenges, which consist in new features for the app.
